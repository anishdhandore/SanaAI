# Original Resume Folder

Place your entire LaTeX resume project folder here.

## Instructions

1. **Place your resume folder**: Copy your `AnishDhandoreResume` folder into this `original/` directory
2. Your folder structure should look like:
   ```
   original/
     └── AnishDhandoreResume/
         ├── resume.tex          # Main resume file (or AnishDhandoreResume.tex)
         ├── resume.cls           # Custom class (if any)
         ├── resume.sty          # Style file (if any)
         ├── images/             # Images folder (if any)
         │   └── photo.jpg
         └── ...                 # Other supporting files
   ```

3. **The system will automatically**:
   - Find your resume in `AnishDhandoreResume/` folder
   - Load the main .tex file automatically
   - Optimize it for each job application
   - Return optimized LaTeX code

4. **After optimization**:
   - Download the optimized .tex file
   - Replace the original .tex file in `AnishDhandoreResume/` folder with the optimized version
   - Or keep separate optimized versions in the `optimized/` folder

## Note

- The system looks for `AnishDhandoreResume/` folder specifically
- Keep all your supporting files (.cls, .sty, images, etc.) in the folder
- Only the main .tex file content will be optimized
- All other files stay unchanged
