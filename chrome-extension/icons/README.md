# Extension Icons

The icon files (icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png) are currently placeholders.

To add your own icons:
1. Create PNG images with the specified dimensions (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
2. Replace the placeholder files
3. Icons should be simple and recognizable at small sizes

You can use any image editor or online tools to create these icons.
